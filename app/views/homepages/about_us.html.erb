  <h5>
    Here at Neopetsy, we believe that all Neopets deserve access to safer neohousing, food and self care resources. The Neopian community
    has faced much uncertainty this year due to the sudden global pandemic crisis amongst neopets' humans.  During this time it is crucial
    to ensure that all neopets find the support they need whilst their humans may be otherwise occupied.
    We founded this organization to link together mutual aid networks across Neopia.
    We strive to support all underserved Neopian families, as well as the rising number of abandoned neopets in Dr. Death's neopound.
